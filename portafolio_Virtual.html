						<h4 class="title font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-4">A bit of History.</h4>

						<p class="mb-3">The Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home are also known as St Mary's Mother and Baby
							Home. Located in Tuam, Galway, Ireland. It was where women and girls from across Mayo and
							Galway were sent to have babies out of wedlock between 1925 and 1961. The Irish Government
							knocked down the place in 1972 to make way for the Dublin Road housing estate a half-mile
							outside Tuam town. But, in the corner of a green left in the middle of the estate, some
							children uncovered a big tank with a collection of skulls and bones beneath a pile of
							rubble. According to the local historian Catherine Corless, the unmarked grave was the final
							resting place for 798 dead children; infants just days old, many toddlers and children as
							old as eight; most were buried only in shrouds without coffins.
						</p>

						</div>

						<h4 class="title font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-4">Project Development.</h4>

						<p class="mb-3">For this project, I decided to do a digital video installation with the
							investigation data and the timeline of this terrible event. The main structure is an
							abstraction of the logo of the Bon Secours Sister. I searched a series of pictures related
							to each period this situation had. I started with the past, then the investigation's
							process, followed by the memorials, protests, and photos of families seeking their origins.
							Finally, the apologies from the Irish government and religious congregation authorities
							headed. Black and white are the colour base and old 3D television models that symbolize the
							past and how this news was scattered and taken into account by the Irish government due to
							international pressure.
						</p>

						</div>

						<h4 class="title font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-4">3D Models and Video Post-production.</h4>


						<p class="mb-3">I chose 3D models of old TVs because of the era in which the facts happened,
							apart from the aesthetics of these televisions being more significant than the ones we
							currently find.
						</p>

						<p class="mb-3">Each of the nine televisions has a different video that refers to the Tuam
							Mother and Baby Home events. I decided to respect the aesthetics of old televisions and the
							glitch errors of that time. For the digital image processing and to avoid author problems,
							the images were treated, so they were not presented as such. Glitch bugs, gameplay with
							layer placement, and white noise video on televisions accentuate this idea. The black and
							white colour of the photos refers to the past, mourning and catastrophe. A count marks the
							beginning of the era of terror in Ireland. We can see various events on other TV during that
							timeline. I wanted to add a tribute to the 798 children's deaths; by showing each of their
							names, ages, and years of their death on the top of this TV installation.

						<h4 class="title font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-4">Digital Montage.</h4>

						<p class="mb-3">The final edition of the videos was assembled as follows: </p>
						<p class="mb-3">It starts with a timeline of the events that occurred. In the second level, we
							find the Tuam
							Mother and Baby Home's past and the protests carried out over these years. In the third
							level, we see images of the investigation, the memorials made and the families that found
							their lost inheritance. On the upper level of the three televisions, we see the names of
							each of the children found in the Tuam Mother and Baby Home investigation.

						<h4 class="title font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-4">Virtual Lighting.</h4>


						<p class="mb-3">For this virtual installation, the colour blue represents the topic discussed
							since it is a cold colour associated with death and spirituality.
							The lighting tests were to define and highlight the abstraction of the Bon Secours Sister
							logo in the shadows of this installation. After Effects, the software that I used to create
							this game of three-dimensionality and shadows, I knew that using this technique was risky
							due to the rendering time involved in the process. Still, I wanted to simulate how the
							exhibition could be seen in an art gallery.

						<h4 class="title font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-4">Conclusion.</h4>


						<p class="mb-3">It is often difficult to talk about sensitive issues such as this case, even
							more so if they are represented with images and video. One in-depth analysis of the
							situation is needed to address the problem and empathise with the content. In my case, it
							was not difficult to handle this information because, unfortunately, in my country, this
							would be an issue that has been normalising in recent years, the deaths of the innocent in
							charge of an imposed system.
							I found in a surprising way how Mexico and Ireland have many similarities. It was not
							difficult for me to address this issue since I have previous experience researching and
							conceptualising social problems.
							However, I would have liked to set up an exhibition like Nam June Paik or Susan Hiller; This
							is the presentation format that I would give my audiovisual proposal.
